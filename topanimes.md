Notable Mentions:
- Neon Genesis Evangelion
  - I enjoyed this anime but the episodes and plot was boring in my opinion. The episodes started to get repetitive because they were pretty much the same thing every time. I enjoyed the artwork though.
- Lupin III: Cagliostro no Shiro
  - It's a movie. I enjoyed the plot and artwork. I recommend it.
- Gunsmith Cats OVA
  - Short OVA with 3 episodes, 30 minutes each. It's a fun watch.
